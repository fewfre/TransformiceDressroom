Whe updating with a new file:
- Fix `$Coeur` (heart) to not have empty frames at the end
- `AnimSit` needs `PiedD_1` bone added into the last empty frame on it's layer - just mark the bone as invisible & at (x:0.9, y:0)
- `AnimCadeau` & `AnimZelda` needs `Oeil_1` bone added into the eyebrow frame(s) on it's layer - just mark the bone as invisible
- Delete all the timeline script actions
	- for anything new, keep track of special script actions (on last frame, unless otherwise noted):
		- `AnimSleep`: `gotoAndPlay(13);`
		- `AnimPlumes`: `gotoAndStop(1);` (twice in a row in same snippet, not sure if it matters)
		- `AnimPeche`: the stop is on the first frame (not sure why; could be decompile bug)
		- `AnimNeige`: `if(parent) Object(parent).x_finAnimNeige();`
		- `AnimMarshmallow`: the stop is on the first frame (not sure why; could be decompile bug)
		- `AnimMad`: `gotoAndStop(1);`
		- `AnimLaugh`: `gotoAndStop(1);`
		- `AnimDrapeau`: `gotoAndStop(1);` (twice in a row in same snippet, not sure if it matters)
		- `AnimDanse`: `gotoAndStop(1);`
		- `AnimCry`: `gotoAndStop(1);`
		- `AnimConfetti`: `if(parent) Object(parent).x_finAnimConfetti();`
		- `AnimClap`: `gotoAndPlay(4);` (twice in a row in same snippet, not sure if it matters)
